I am broadly interested in the study and manipulation of materials that possess complex optical, electronic and mechanical properties at the nanoscale. Not only can materials with interesting physics be used to construct devices with new functionality, but the devices themselves can also be employed as a platform to probe new science.

Lithium Niobate
---
Lithium niobate (LiNbO3, LN) is a trigonal crystal well-known in the photonics industry for its usage in the electro-optic modulators foundational to fiber-optic communications. LN is a highly nonlinear material, with large $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear optical susceptibilities, in addition to favorable piezoelectric, electro-optic, photoelastic, and ferroelectric properties. Recently, the development of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) in conjunction with advances in microfabrication techniques has enabled much strong optical confinement than traditional Ti-indiffused LN waveguides, ushering in a new generation of integrated photonic devices. 

A review of the material properties can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00614817) whereas an overview of TFLN's application in integrated photonics can be found [here](https://opg.optica.org/aop/abstract.cfm?uri=aop-13-2-242).
