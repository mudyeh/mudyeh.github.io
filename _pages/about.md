I am a PhD student in Applied Physics at Harvard University. I received my BS degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 2020, where I majored in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS). My research interests lie broadly at the intersection between integrated photonics, quantum optics, and materials science.
