I am a PhD student in Applied Physics at Harvard University, co-advised by [Marko Loncar](https://nano-optics.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Evelyn Hu](https://hugroup.seas.harvard.edu/). I received my BS degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 2020, where I majored in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS). My research interests lie broadly at the intersection between integrated photonics, quantum optics, and materials science. 

I am fortunate to be supported by a [Harvard Quantum Initiative (HQI)](https://quantum.harvard.edu/) Graduate Fellowship and a [NDSEG](https://ndseg.org/) Fellowship.
