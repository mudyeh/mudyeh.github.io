I will be a PhD student in Applied Physics at Harvard University, beginning Fall 2020. I received my BS degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 2020, where I majored in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS). My research interests lie broadly in engineering light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, with applications in photonics, optoelectronics, and quantum information.
