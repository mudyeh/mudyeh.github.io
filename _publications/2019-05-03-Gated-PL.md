"Defects in conventional semiconductors substantially lower the photoluminescence (PL)
quantum yield (QY), a key metric of optoelectronic performance that directly dictates
the maximum device efficiency. Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs), such as monolayer MoS2, often exhibit low PL QY for as-processed samples,
which has typically been attributed to a large native defect density. We show that the PL QY
of as-processed MoS2 and WS2 monolayers reaches near-unity when they are made
intrinsic through electrostatic doping, without any chemical passivation. Surprisingly,
neutral exciton recombination is entirely radiative even in the presence of a high native
defect density. This finding enables TMDC monolayers for optoelectronic device
applications as the stringent requirement of low defect density is eased."
